# What's New

The latest release includes updates for setting permissions, deleting boards, and sticky defaults.

- Ability to set permissions for accessing the retrospective board now restricted to the board owner or a team admin.
- Functionality to delete boards was moved from the Board menu to the History table and is only enabled for archived boards.
- User settings for maximum votes, Team Assessment, Prime Directive, obscure feedback, and anonymous feedback are saved and used as defaults when the user creates the next retrospective board.

Refer to the [Changelog](https://github.com/microsoft/vsts-extension-retrospectives/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) for a comprehensive listing of the updates included in this release and past releases.
