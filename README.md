# Retrospectives

![Coverage Badge](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://gist.githubusercontent.com/mhassaninmsft/b414faf6b91eaaa6ec7d82882be36935/raw/retrotool__heads_dev.json)

Retrospectives is an [Azure DevOps](https://dev.azure.com) extension to perform _smart and efficient retrospectives from within the Azure DevOps pipeline._

Retrospectives are an important part of the software engineering cycle. Teams often use external
retrospective tools, white board with Post-its, OneNote, etc to conduct retrospectives. The data
then needs to be collated, and any actionable items need to be created in your Azure DevOps pipeline.
The [Retrospectives extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-devlabs.team-retrospectives)
allows you to do all this and more from within Azure DevOps.

    the retrospective is circled in red.](https://github.com/microsoft/vsts-extension-retrospectives/raw/main/RetrospectiveExtension.Frontend/images/usage/boardandretrospectivestab.png)

2. This will navigate you to the Retrospectives page. Select your Azure DevOps team from the selector
in the header.

    ![A screenshot of the Retrospective tool's landing page. At the top of the page there is a dropdown
    selection for which team circled in red.](https://github.com/microsoft/vsts-extension-retrospectives/raw/main/RetrospectiveExtension.Frontend/images/usage/teamselection.png)

3. Create a new retrospective using the 'Create Board' button. If you have created retrospectives
before, use the selector to go to a particular retrospective, or create a new one using the options
button and then clicking on 'Create new board'.

    ![A screenshot of the Retrospective tool's team page if there are no existing retrospective boards.
    No board has been created so there is a message of 'Get started with your first retrospective' in
    the center of the screen with a simplified image of a two-colomned retrospective. Below that there
    is a blue button to click that says 'Create Board,' which is circled in red.](https://github.com/microsoft/vsts-extension-retrospectives/raw/main/RetrospectiveExtension.Frontend/images/usage/createretrospective.png)

    ![A screen shot of the Retrospective tool's team view if there are any existing boards. From a
    dropdown beside an existing board's title, which is the Board Actions Menu. The first selection on
    the list is the 'Create new board,' which is circled in red.](https://github.com/microsoft/vsts-extension-retrospectives/raw/main/RetrospectiveExtension.Frontend/images/usage/createretrospective2.png)

    When you select **New Board** or **Create new baord** as above, you will see the following dialog:
    ![A screenshot showing the modal box that controls the initial settings for creating a retrospective
    board. The settings include: a text field for title of the retrospective; a checkbox for each of
    the settings about feedback visibility/anonymity; a number field for the maximum number of votes
    each participant can use; and the different columns to include in the retrospective, either
    customized or loaded from a template. The maximum  number of votes field is highlighted in yellow.](https://github.com/microsoft/vsts-extension-retrospectives/raw/main/RetrospectiveExtension.Frontend/images/usage/createretrospectivewithmaxvotes.png)
  </br>
    Please enter the appropriate information:

    - **Retrospective Title**: Enter appropriate text
    - **Do not display names in feedback**: When you select this checkbox, user names for the item
        reators will not be displayed.
    - **Only show feedback after Collect phase**: When selected, users cannot see other users input
        until they have moved to another phase. Other users' feedback will be blurred.
    - **Max Votes per User (Current 5)**: This options lets the board creator control how many total
        votes (across all columns) that each user can have. Default is 5. While this option can be updated
        through the _Edit retrospective_ option, please note that this update cannot decrement votes
        already in place.
    - **Colums**: You can either Apply from a preselected templates or individually select and configure
        columns
    </br> </br>Retrospective Title is the minimum 'required' information (other fields can stay at
        default as needed). Ones the title is provided, the [Save] button is enabled. Save the retrospective
        using the [Save] button.

        ![A screenshot showing the dropdown for searching available retrospective boards after they've
        been created. The text field to search in circled in red.](https://github.com/microsoft/vsts-extension-retrospectives/raw/main/RetrospectiveExtension.Frontend/images/usage/navigatetoretrospective.png)

      Once you have created the retrospective boards and you want to select a board different from the
      currently displayed board, click on the board name (e.g. Demo board in the image) and select the
      desired board. You can use the search box to find the appropriate boards if you have a large number
      of boards.

4. If you created a new retrospective in step 3, give your retrospective an appropriate name and
  click 'Save'. This will create and navigate you to your newly created retrospective.

      ![A screenshot on the first 'Create New Board' modal. Underneath the stylized illustration of
      a retrospective board, the text field for the board's title has an example title of 'Retrospective
      December 2018' with two buttons beneah it, one for 'Save' and one to cancel out of the modal.](https://github.com/microsoft/vsts-extension-retrospectives/raw/main/RetrospectiveExtension.Frontend/images/usage/createretrospectiveform.png)

5. Once you create a new retrospective, you can share a link to it to all participants. Users can
  then access that link even from their mobile browsers to participate in the retrospective. The
  extension offers real time synchronisation, so all users will see the most upto date information
  without having to refresh the page.

      ![A screenshot of the dropdown from the Board Actions Menu. The option for 'Copy Board Link' is
      circled in red.](https://github.com/microsoft/vsts-extension-retrospectives/raw/main/RetrospectiveExtension.Frontend/images/usage/boardlink.png)

6. Each Retrospective by default has 2 columns, one for things that went well and another for those
  that did not. Performing a retrospective is divided into 4 phases.

- **Collect** - In this phase feedback is collected from all participants. Users can add feedback
    under either of the columns using the 'Add new card' button. Once feedback from all users is
    collected, move onto the next phase.

    ![A screenshot of an example retrospective board column. The button for 'Add new card' is circled
    in yellow, and an empty feedback item card is also circled in yellow.](https://github.com/microsoft/vsts-extension-retrospectives/raw/main/RetrospectiveExtension.Frontend/images/usage/createfeedback.png)

- **Group** - In this phase, the similar feedback is grouped together. If you feel 2 feedback items
    are similar, drag one onto another to group them together. Dragging any item onto a group, will add
    items to that group. Once all similar items are grouped together, move on to the next phase.

    ![A screenshot of an example retrospective in the 'Group' phase shows a number of feedback items,
    two rows of two cards. Of the bottom two cards, there is an indicator that it is composed of
    multiple cards with collapsible dropdowns of two items. The left grouping is collapsed so only
    the 'top' card is visible, and the right grouping is expanded to show all the items in the group
    listed.](https://github.com/microsoft/vsts-extension-retrospectives/raw/main/RetrospectiveExtension.Frontend/images/usage/groupfeedback.png)

- **Vote** - In this phase, participants will individually go through all the feedback items and vote
    on the ones they feel are important, by clicking on the 'Upvote' icon. Users can reduce their number
    of votes on a specific item by clicking on the 'Downvote' icon. </br> Note the _Max Votes per User_
    set by the board creator are displayed above the board along with the votes used by the user. Votes
    used by the user are updated in real time as the user clicks on 'Upvote' and 'Downvote' icons.
    </br></br> Once everyone is done voting, move on to the next phase.

    ![A screenshot of an example retrospective in the 'Vote' phase. Along the top of the page there
    is a subheading that indicates that the maximum number of votes per participant is 5, and that
    the example user has already voted 4 times; this subheading is circled in yellow. There are three
    example feedback items that are in two columns. 'Item2' and 'Item1' are in the 'What went well'
    column and 'Item3' is in the 'What didn't go well' column. The four votes are indicated on each
    of the cards: 'Item2' has two votes, 'Item1' has one vote, and 'Item3' has one. The number of
    votes is circled in yellow.](https://github.com/microsoft/vsts-extension-retrospectives/raw/main/RetrospectiveExtension.Frontend/images/usage/maxvotes.png)

- **Act** - In this phase, the team will go through each feedback item and create work items in Azure
    DevOps if needed. Click on the 'Add action item' button on a feedback card, and select the type of
    work item that needs to be created. This will open up the standard Azure DevOps work item creation
    form. Enter the work item details and save. This will create the work item in your Azure DevOps
    account and also associate it to the feedback item.

    ![A screenshot of an example retrospective in the 'Act' phase. On one of the example feedback
    items, the button for 'Add Action Item' has been pressed to reveal a selection of options. The
    user has the option to create a number of different Azure Dev Ops items, like adding a bug, a
    user story, and others. In this case, the item that is circled in red is the 'Bug' option.](https://github.com/microsoft/vsts-extension-retrospectives/raw/main/RetrospectiveExtension.Frontend/images/usage/addactionitem.png)

    ![A screenshot of a new Azure Dev ops Bug item, which is understood to be the result of the
    previous screenshot, that is in a modal on top of the example retrospective. A title of 'new bug'
    has been entered and has been circled in red. The button to 'Save and Close' is also circled.](https://github.com/microsoft/vsts-extension-retrospectives/raw/main/RetrospectiveExtension.Frontend/images/usage/newbugform.png)

    ![A screenshot of the retrospective board again, that is understood to be the result of the new
    bug being created, saved, and then closed. The difference is now beneath the feedback card, there
    is a list of connected 'Action Items' that includes this new bug story. This new bug is circled
    in red.](https://github.com/microsoft/vsts-extension-retrospectives/raw/main/RetrospectiveExtension.Frontend/images/usage/addactionitemsaved.png)
